<p><strong>The Misconception</strong>: You do nice things for the people you like and bad things to the people you hate.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth</strong>: You grow to like people for whom you do nice things and hate people you harm.</p>
<p>As clerk, he could step into a waterfall of data coming out of the nascent government. He would record and print public records, bills, vote totals and other official documents. He would also make a fortune literally printing the state's paper money. He won the race, but the next election wasn't going to be as easy. Franklin's autobiography never mentions this guy's name, but according to the book when Franklin ran for his second term as clerk, one of his colleagues delivered a long speech to the legislature lambasting Franklin. Franklin still won his second term, but this guy truly pissed him off. In addition, this man was "a gentleman of fortune and education" who Franklin believed would one day become a person of great influence in the government. So, Franklin knew he had to be dealt with, and thus he launched his human behavior stealth bomber.</p>
<p>Franklin set out to turn his hater into a fan, but he wanted to do it without "paying any servile respect to him." Franklin's reputation as a book collector and library founder gave him a reputation as a man of discerning literary tastes, so Franklin sent a letter to the hater asking if he could borrow a selection from the his library, one which was a "very scarce and curious book." The rival, flattered, sent it right away. Franklin sent it back a week later with a thank you note. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p>The next time the legislature met, the man approached Franklin and spoke to him in person for the first time. Franklin said the hater "ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became great friends, and our friendship continued to his death."</p>
<p>What exactly happened here? How can asking for a favor turn a hater into a fan? How can requesting kindness cause a person to change his or her opinion about you? The answer to what generates The Benjamin Franklin Effect is the answer to much more about why you do what you do.</p>
<p>The things you do often create the things you believe.</p>

<p>Self perception theory shows you unconsciously observe your own actions and then explain them in a pleasing way without ever realizing it. Benjamin Franklin's enemy observed himself performing a generous and positive act by offering the treasured tome to his rival, and then he unconsciously explained his own behavior to himself. He must not have hated Franklin after all, he thought; why else would he do something like that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land. This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity." - Albert Camus</em></p>

<p>Many psychologists would explain the Benjamin Franklin effect through the lens of cognitive dissonance, a giant theory made up of thousands of studies which have pinpointed a menagerie of mental stumbling blocks including <a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/23/confirmation-bias/">confirmation bias</a>, <a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/14/hindsight-bias/">hindsight bias</a>, <a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/">the backfire effect</a>, <a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/03/25/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/">the sunk cost fallacy</a>, and many more, but as a general theory it describes something you experience every day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"These findings do not mean that people enjoy painful experiences, such as filling out their income-tax forms, or that people enjoy things because they are associated with pain. What they do show is that if a person voluntarily goes through a difficult or a painful experience in order to attain some goal or object, that goal or object becomes more attractive." - _Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson from their book</em> Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)_</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You tend to like the people to whom you are kind and dislike the people to whom you are rude. From the Stanford Prison Experiment to Abu Ghraib, to concentration camps and the attitudes of soldiers spilling blood, mountains of evidence suggest behaviors create attitudes when harming just as they do when helping. Jailers come to look down on inmates; camp guards come to dehumanize their captives; soldiers create derogatory terms for their enemies. It's difficult to hurt someone you admire. It's even more difficult to kill a fellow human being. Seeing the casualties you create as something less than you, something deserving of damage, makes it possible to continue seeing yourself as a good and honest person, to continue being sane.</p>
<p>Pay attention to when the cart is getting before the horse. Notice when a painful initiation leads to irrational devotion, or when unsatisfying jobs start to seem worthwhile. Remind yourself pledges and promises have power, as do uniforms and parades. Remember in the absence of extrinsic rewards you will seek out or create intrinsic ones. Take into account the higher the price you pay for your decisions the more you value them. See that ambivalence becomes certainty with time. Realize lukewarm feelings become stronger once you commit to a group, club or product. Be wary of the roles you play and the acts you put on, because you tend to fulfill the labels you accept. Above all, remember the more harm you cause, the more hate you feel, and the more kindness you deal into the world the more you come to love the people you help.</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"This is another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which says, 'He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.' And it shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove, than to resent, return, and continue inimical proceedings." </em>- Benjamin Franklin</p>
