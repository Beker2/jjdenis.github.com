        <p>De un viejo libro de etiqueta. Encontramos, estre otros: nunca traicionar la confianza dada, nunca preguntar a un niño sobre temas de familia, y la mejor la última: Nuestra casa debería ser nuestro cielo.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Never forget that, if you are faithful in a few things, you may be ruler over many.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never exhibit too great familiarity with the new acquaintance, you may give offense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never will a gentleman allude to conquests which he may have made with ladies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never be guilty of the contemptible meanness of opening a private letter addressed to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never fail to offer the easiest and best seat in the room to an invalid, an elderly person, or a lady.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never neglect to perform the commission which the friend entrusted to you. You must not forget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never send your guest, who is accustomed to a warm room, off into  a cold, damp, spare bed, to sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never enter a room filled with people, without a slight bow to the general company when first entering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never fail to answer an invitation, either personally or by letter, within a week after the invitation is received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never accept of favors and hospitality without rendering an exchange of civilities when opportunity offers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never cross the leg and put one foot in the street-car, or places where it will trouble others when passing by.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never fail to tell the truth. If truthful, you get your reward. You will get your punishment if you deceive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never borrow money and neglect to pay. If you do, you will soon be known as a person of no business integrity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never write to another asking for information, or a favor of any kind, without enclosing a postage stamp for the reply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never fail to say kind and encouraging words to those whom you meet in distress. Your kindness may lift them out of their despair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never refuse to receive an apology. You may not receive friendship, but courtesy will require, when a apology is offered, that you accept it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never examine the cards in the card-basket. While they may be exposed in the drawing room, you are not expected to turn them over unless invited to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never, when walking arm in arm with a lady, be continually changing and going to the other side, because of change of corners. It shows too much attention to form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never insult another with harsh words when applied to for a favor. Kind words do not cost much, and yet they may carry untold happiness to the one to whom they are spoken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never fail to speak kindly. If a merchant, and you address your clerk; if an overseer, and you address your workman; if in any position where you exercise authority, you show yourself to be a gentleman by your pleasant mode of address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never attempt to convey the impression that you are a genius, by imitating the faults of distinguished men. Because certain great men were poor penmen, wore long hair, or had other peculiarities, it does not follow that you will be great by imitating their eccentricities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never give all your pleasant words and smile to strangers. The kindest words and the sweetest smiles should be reserved for home. Home should be our heaven.    “We have careful thought for the strangers<br />
And smiles for the sometimes guest;<br />
But oft for our own the bitter tone,<br />
Though we love our own the best.<br />
Ah! lips with the curl impatient-<br />
‘Twere a cruel fate were the night too late<br />
To undo the work of the morn.”</p>
</li>
