Consejos del general Lee a sus hijos. Todavía no me toca dar consejos, pero cada vez me voy pareciendo más todos los padres que lo fueron antes que yo.




1. On debt and frugal living: “It is easier to make our wishes conform to our means, than to make our means to conform to our wishes.”




2. On marriage: “Never marry unless you can do so into a family that will enable your children to feel proud of both sides of the house.”  Don’t wife hunt in bars or tattoo parlors.




3. On minding your own business: “Meddle or interfere with nothing with which you have no concern.”




4. On humility: “It’s all my fault.” ~ Lee at Gettysburg. Be willing to admit your mistakes and take blame.




5. On honesty: “Private and public life are subject to the same rules; and truth and manliness are two qualities that will carry you through this world much better than policy, or tact, or expediency, or any other word that was ever devised to conceal or mystify a deviation from a straight line.” ~ One of Lee’s personal maxims. A young man should say what he means and mean what he says. Avoid the demeaning examples of politicians, government bureaucrats, and lawyers.




6. On manliness: “A man may manifest and communicate his joy, but he should conceal and smother his grief as much as possible.”




7. On work: “There is scarcely anything that is right that we cannot hope to accomplish by labor and perseverance. But the first must be earnest and the second unremitting.” ~
