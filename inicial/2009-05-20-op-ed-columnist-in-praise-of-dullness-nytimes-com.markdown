title: Being a good C.E.O. Traits like being a good listener, a good team builder,
  an enthusiastic colleague, a great communicator do not seem to be very important
  when it comes to leading successful companies. What mattered, it turned out, were
  execution and organizational skills. The traits that correlated most powerfully
  with success were attention to detail, persistence, efficiency, analytic thoroughness
  and the ability to work long hours.
