> Here is a 12- step list of what to do. Go as far down the list as you can in whatever time frame you can manage. The further along the list you stop, the healthier you are likely to be. There is no counting, measuring, or weighing. You are not required to purchase anything specific from me or anyone else. There are no special supplements, drugs or testing required.*

> **1. [Eliminate sugar](http://www.paleonu.com/panu-weblog/2009/6/28/1-eliminate-sugar-and-refined-carbohydrates-like-white-flour.html) (including fruit juices and sports drinks that contain HFCS) and all foods that contain flour. **

> **2. Start eating proper fats - Use healthy [animal fats](http://www.paleonu.com/panu-weblog/2009/6/22/fats-and-oils.html) to substitute fat calories for calories that formerly came from sugar and flour. **

> 
> 3. Eliminate gluten [grains](http://www.paleonu.com/panu-weblog/2009/6/23/the-argument-against-cereal-grains.html). Limit grains like corn and rice, which are nutritionally poor.
> 
> 

> 
> 4. Eliminate [grain and seed derived oils](http://www.paleonu.com/panu-weblog/2009/6/22/fats-and-oils.html) (cooking oils) Cook with Ghee, butter, animal fats, or coconut oil. Use no temperate plant oils like corn, soy, canola, flax, walnut, etc.
>

> 
> 5. Favor ruminants like beef, lamb and bison for your red meat. Eat eggs and fish.
> 
> 

> 
> 6. Make sure you are Vitamin D replete. Get daily midday sun or consider supplementation.
> 
> 

> 
> 7. 2 or 3 meals a day is best. Don't graze like a herbivore.
> 
> 

> 
> 8. Attend to your [6s and 3s](http://www.paleonu.com/panu-weblog/2009/5/18/6s-and-3s-and-the-logic-of-grain-avoidance.html). Pastured (grass fed) dairy and grass fed beef or bison has a more optimal 6:3 ratio, more vitamins and CLA. If you can't eat enough pastured products, eat plenty of fish.

> 
> 9. Get proper exercise - emphasizing resistance and interval training over long aerobic sessions.
> 
> 

> 
> 10. Most modern fruit is just a candy bar from a tree. Go easy on bags of sugar like apples. Stick with berries and avoid watermelon which is pure fructose. Eat in moderation. If you are not trying to lose fat, a few pieces of fruit a day are fine.
>

> 
> 11. Eliminate legumes
>

> 
> 12. If you are allergic to milk protein or concerned about theoretical risks of casein, you can stick to butter and cream and avoid milk and soft cheeses.

> **Archevores typically range from 5-35% carbohydrate, from 10-30% protein and from 50 to 80% fat (mostly from animals) but wider ranges are entirely possible if you are not dieting and you are meticulous about the quality of your animal food sources.**
> 
> 

> 
> If you are trying to lose weight, really minimizing fructose and eating 50-70g a day of CHO as starch is recommended. If you are at your desired weight and healthy,  20% of calories as carbs is plenty for most very active people. Skipping breakfast or at least no carbs for breakfast can be very helpful.

> 
> **Archevore diets tend to be lower carbohydrate than the standard american diet (SAD) because you can only eat so much, and eating animals gives you lots of fat.  But it is emphatically not a "low carb" diet as you do not count anything, you just avoid certain foods that happen to be largely carbohydrate.**
> 
> 

> 
> **Note that "Fat" and "Carbohydrate" are macronutrient categories that each contain good and bad.**
> 
> 

> 
> **Saturated and monounsaturated fat is generally good. More than 4% of calories from PUFA (whether n3 or n6) is bad.**
> 
> 

> 
> **For healthy non-diabetics, starch (glucose polymers) is good. Excess fructose is bad.**
> 
> 

> 
> **In wheat, the carbohydrate starch is not the major problem. It is the gluten proteins and wheat germ agglutinin that come along with the starch.**
> 
> 

> 
> **So forget "carbs vs fat". It is neolithic agents of disease versus everything else.**
> 
> 

> 
> **Most Archevores only know macronutrient metrics in retrospect, as they don't target numbers just like wild humans didn't target numbers.**
> 
> 

> 
> **If you are not trying to lose weight and you like to eat potatoes and rice, EAT THEM. **
> 
> 

> 
> **Sweet potatoes, white rice and white potatoes are well tolerated by most people and starchy vegetables per se are not neolithic agents of disease. Many active people without diabetes or metabolic syndrome feel and function better with a fair amount of starch in their diet . YMMV!**
> 
> 

> 
> _Note: The order of the steps is arrived at by balancing my best guest at the noxiousness of each neolithic agent with the prevalence of each agent in the north american diet and the effort/reward ratio of the step. If your culture has a different diet the order of the steps might change. For instance, Chinese who fry everything they eat in soybean oil and don't eat much wheat would move step four up to the step one position._
