Follow your heart, always. Use your brain to give yourself as much security and safety as you can as your heart wanders.

That means when you earn money, save some of it. Build up a big emergency fund in a savings account, then start investing some of it into the stock market with some index funds.

Similarly, when you have a chance to pick up a new skill of any kind, jump on it.

When you have the chance to establish a new relationship with someone, jump on it.

The more relationships you have, the more money you have, the more skills you have, the easier it’s going to be to follow your heart.

If you don’t do these things and take the easy path, you’re going to find yourself throughout your life being tied down to your circumstances, watching great opportunities pass you by, and that will leave you with nothing but regret.
