  53. Never attempt to convey the impression that you are a genius, by imitating the faults of distinguished men. Because certain great men were poor penmen, wore long hair, or had other peculiarities, it does not follow that you will be great by imitating their eccentricities.

  54. Never give all your pleasant words and smile to strangers. The kindest words and the sweetest smiles should be reserved for home. Home should be our heaven.    “We have careful thought for the strangers  
And smiles for the sometimes guest;  
But oft for our own the bitter tone,  
Though we love our own the best.  
Ah! lips with the curl impatient-  
‘Twere a cruel fate were the night too late  
To undo the work of the morn.”
